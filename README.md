# Processing-with-Phant
Code for Phant from Jeff Branson
The bars in the RX sketch are set by clicking and dragging over them, this sets an RGB value.
By hitting any key on the keyboard 
it sends the value to your data.sparkfun.com cahnnel, the example sketch is set to a channel I set up, use it with descretion please.
The feed is throttled to lock out for 12 seconds after a keypress in order to keep inside the logging parameters of data.sparkfun.com.

The TX sketch pulls the data from the data channel and rebuilds the color you set in TX.
